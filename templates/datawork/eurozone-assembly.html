            The introduction of the Euro as a common currency was a bold step towards more economic integration in Europe. However, while the founding Euro-members took this large step in the
            field of monetary policy, to this day they very much struggle to follow suit in other political domains, most importantly fiscal policy. This is why economists often call the Eurozone
            an “incomplete monetary union”. The Eurozone's main problem is, therefore, not an economic but a political one: The Eurozone has made too little progress
            with regard to political integration. When its founding fathers
            constructed the Euro, they assumed that economic integration would – sooner or later – force member countries to deepen political integration. And although the economic reality has
            indeed rendered more political integration an urgent necessity, only small progress as been made due to the resistance of national policy makers to give up parts of their own power.
        </p>

            As a result, the necessary coordination in the Eurozone is often done through strict rules, such as the infamous fiscal rules regarding (national) budget policies. However, as argued
            among others by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/article/36/106/195/6122701?login=false" target="_blank">Olivier Blanchard</a>, strict numerical rules face a trade-off
            between complexity and flexibility. Rules that allow the right policy in all possible situations would be so complex that they would not be implementable in practice or transparently
            verifiable. This is a big problem especially in current times of multiple overlapping crises. For the Eurozone to find tailored responses to current challenges, they need to work out solutions
            together, instead of acting nationally in a rigid common framework. For this common deliberation and decision-making, a parliamentary body is needed, which reflects the
            pluralism of opinions both within and between member countries.
            A>t the moment, the main body of the Eurozone is the Eurogroup, where the finance ministers of the member states come together in a rather untransparent and undemocratic manner.

            Following <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2017/03/22/what-would-a-euro-zone-assembly-look-like/" target="_blank">a proposal</a> described by Thomas Piketty,
            the Eurozone should introduce a parliamentary assembly where delegates from the national parliaments make binding decisions for the Eurozone as a whole. For example, they could
            vote on national budget plans (following common guidelines instead of rigid rules). or hold the ECB accountable for its monetary policy.
            Seats in this assembly would be assigned to the member countries relative to their population size
            (e.g., Germany would have more delegates than Luxembourg). The national seat contingent would then be distributed amongst national parties relative to their share in the main national parliamentary body
            (e.g., in the Camera dei deputati for Italy). The figure below implements this distributional rule for an Eurozone Assembly with 150 seats, guaranteeing that each country has at least one delegate
            (e.g., Luxembourg would otherwise have no delegate). To make national parties comparable, they are sorted into their parliamentary group in the European Parliament. However, one must take this
            sorting with more than just a grain of salt, because the national background is often more important for the policy stance of national parties than their political family.
            For example, a right-wing party in Italy would probably want
            to have more leeway for deficit spending, while a right-wing party in Germany would want to prevent exactly that. Therefore, one has to look at both the inner and the outer ring to get a feeling
            for the political landscape in such an Assembly.

      <h2 class="title">The Euro: What went wrong and where to go</h2>

      <p>
        In a world dominated by headlines about the energy crisis and the Ukraine crisis it is easy to forget how many other, once heatedly discussed crises and problems are still ongoing or unresolved.
        Between 2010 and 2015, for example, it was virtually impossible to watch European news without a mentioning of the Eurocrisis. And while it is true that the peak of the Eurocrisis lays behind us,
        the crisis has rather passed by than that it’s underlying causes have been resolved. As a consequence, the economic performance of the Eurozone was still problematic even before the Coronavirus,
        especially with regard to the North-South gap, and in comparison to other economies worldwide.

        The Euro is currently not in deadly peril, but it is still sick. In fact, it has been sick since the very beginning, when German chancellor Gerhard Schröder described it as a “premature infant”.
        The aim of this article is to analyse the architecture of the Eurozone and identify important elements of its much-needed repair, foremost by looking at the historical roots for various current problems.
        As we will see, the Euro suffers less from economic problems but from political ones, and the shaky state of the Eurozone should not come as a surprise to politicians involved in its creation.
        The article begins with a look at the <a href="#1">economic scene in Europe before 1991</a>, continues with a deep look into the <a href="#2">political interests</a> forming the Maastricht framework,
        analyses this framework with regard to <a href="#3">fiscal policy</a> and <a href="#4">monetary policy</a>, and connects it to <a href="#5">economic ideas</a>.
        Afterwards, it looks at the damage this has caused from the <a href="#6">early decade</a> to the <a href="#7">Eurocrisis</a> (with a special focus on <a href="#8">Greece</a>).
        The last part focuses on solving the Euro's problem, especially on the need for a <a href="#9">fiscal union</a> and a <a href="#10">political union</a>.

        There has never been such a momentum and enthusiasm for European integration as in the years after the second World War. However, even then it lacked political support: While France and Germany did agree on the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950, which was indeed an important step towards more European collaboration, this was born out of national power political interests and not the “realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation” (Robert Schuman) that does not exist to this day. In the same year, a proposal by the French prime minister for a common European Army (that, again, does not exist to this day) was rejected by the French parliament, with one deputy stating that French soldiers are ready to die for France, but not for Europe. Nevertheless, in the two decades after the war, there have been remarkable achievements for European integration, most notably the Treaty of Rome in 1957 establishing the European Economic Community and starting the development of the European single market (although it is worth mentioning that the French consent to the abolishment of intra-EEC custom barriers had to be bought with the Common Agriculture Policy, i.e., subsidies to France’s big farming sector). However, currency arrangements at the time were a global and not a European affair.

      <p>
        Even before the end of the second world war, forty-four countries met in Bretton Woods and agreed on a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates. Countries maintained a certain exchange rate vis-à-vis the US-Dollar, which was convertible into gold at a fixed rate. Because of capital controls, national central banks had at the beginning considerable freedom in choosing their national monetary policy, although their leeway shrunk due to the increasing liberalization of capital flows. If a country faced changing fundamentals and, for example, ended up in a situation where it ran a permanent current account deficit (more imports than exports), it was allowed to adjust its exchange rate, even though devaluations were politically unpopular. The International Monetary Fund was established to supervise the currency system and support member countries in case of economic crises with loans and expertise, while the Worldbank was supposed to help countries to finance the reconstruction after the war. When the USA effectively terminated the Bretton Woods system in 1971, European countries were eager to find an alternative for stabilizing their exchange rates to foster cross-country economic activities. Therefore, they invented a system which was dubbed the “Snake in the Tunnel” or just “Snake”, where the member states agreed on limiting exchange rate movements to +/- 2.25% relative to each other and collectively against the US-Dollar. For that, national central banks had to intervene in the exchange rate markets by selling or buying foreign reserves. The new system faced a very difficult global environment with a freely floating US-Dollar, the oil crisis in 1973, and other commodity market disruptions, so that many national banks were not able to stabilize their exchange rates while at the same time supporting their domestic economies. Even though the Snake officially existed until 1979, most of its members were forced to leave the arrangement within two years and only Germany remained a member for its entire existence. Nevertheless, European countries sticked to the objective of stabilizing exchange rates and invented the European Monetary System as a replacement in 1979. The crucial innovation was the introduction of the ECU as a unit of account, which represented the weighted average of all member currencies and against which members had to adjust their exchange rates. Therefore, the adjustment burden was not only one the shoulders of one member: In case the Austrian Schilling devalued, this altered the value of the ECU, cushioning the Austrian exchange rate movement and shifting a part of the adjustment burden to the other countries, whose exchange rates had automatically also changed vis-à-vis the ECU. The rather successful first years of the EMU made Great Britain join the system in 1990 – a fatal mistake. Similar to the USA in the Bretton Woods system, the EMS was dominated by Germany due to its size (e.g., the D-Mark influenced the ECU more than the Schilling) and the Bundesbank’s pursuit of a low inflation, high interest monetary policy (which attracts capital flows appreciating the D-Mark and devaluing other currencies). The latter was especially problematic since capital movements between European countries had been more-or-less fully liberalized in 1990. When Germany increased its fiscal expenditure after its surprising reunification, the Bundesbank reacted with strong interest rate hikes, which forced EMS partners to also increase their interest rates (to avoid devaluations), which harmed their economies. In the end, the Bank of England was forced to let the pound float against the ECU and leave the EMU after rapid capital outflows towards Germany and a speculative attack by George Soros. This “Black Wednesday” left a mark in British economic history, and the previous era of harmfully high interest rates required by the EMS  made many Brits wary against giving up too much sovereignty for European integration. Other European countries also suffered, especially those like France which decided to hike interest rates enough to stay in the EMS. To safeguard those countries against further speculative attacks, the band in which exchange rate movements were allowed was widened from +/- 2.25% to 15%.
      </p>

      <div id="2" >
      </div>
      <p>
        Effectively, there were three options after the EMS crisis of 1992: Establish capital controls (allowing fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policy just as in the early Bretton Woods system), accept German leadership, or completely freeze exchange rates (making speculative attacks impossible). Europeans under the leadership of Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl chose the third option. Why? France pushed for the Euro because it wanted to end the German dominance under a D-Mark centred system. For France, it was better to have a common central bank built by the Germans than having the Bundesbank under the sole control of the Germans. Mitterrand also wanted to prevent more politically costly devaluations, although it is obvious that one cannot simply “forbid” a symptom without curing the cause (just as a cold is not cured by taping the patients mouth so that he cannot sneeze anymore). Additionally, it has always been the goal of French politics to establish a multipolar order with at least Europe as a counterpart to the almighty USA and a common currency as a counterpart to the US-Dollar. However, France was not ready to give up core elements of its sovereignty. That is why it always resisted Kohl’s calls for a political union, although he had correctly acknowledged that “the creation of the EMU and of the political union are inseparably connected. The political union is the essential counterpart to the EMU.” However, it is important to state that by this Kohl envisioned common policy but no fiscal transfers of German money to other countries, as he often declared publicly. It is unclear why Kohl stopped demanding a political union as a prerequisite for a monetary union, especially since this course had the full support of the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank was vehemently opposed to monetary integration because it did not want to give up its control over monetary policy, which it considered to be very successful. To this day, the reputation of the Bundesbank is – at least in Germany – very high, although its obsession with keeping inflation low not only caused economic problems that brought down three chancellors, but also did damage to European partners. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank deserves credit for warning against monetary unification both in Germany and in Europe. Especially in Germany, where Kohl was eager to bring the D-Mark to Eastern states at a conversion ratio of 1:1, it rightfully predicted that this would destroy most of the much less productive companies in the East. With regard to the Euro, it further propagated the “crowning theory” stating that a common currency can only be the end point of both political and economic convergence and integration. This view had been best summarized by former Bundesbank president Karl Blessing in 1963:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “The Commission's ultimate goal is a European monetary union. (...) As a European, I would be prepared to agree to the ideal of a European monetary union and also to accept a centrally controlled federal central banking system; but as a responsible central bank practitioner and realist, I cannot help pointing out the difficulties which stand in the way of the realization of a monetary union. A common currency and a federal central banking system are conceivable only if, in addition to a common trade policy, there is also a common financial and budget policy, a common social and wage policy, in other words, a common policy altogether, in short, if there is a federal state with a European Parliament that has legislative powers vis-à-vis all member states.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Against this, Kohl and other politicians in favour of a common currency put the “falling forward” theory. They reasoned that a common currency would make closing those gaps in political integration, once exposed in times of crisis, imperative to close. This argument ignores a big problem: During a crisis induced or reinforced by a European currency, it is very difficult to sell to electorates that the solution lies in even more European integration. Both Nicholas Kaldor and Milton Friedman made this exact point. But Kohl thought he had to bet on the “falling forward” theory because he considered himself to be the last German chancellor willing and able to push through such a big transfer of sovereignty. Fearing that a united Germany would seek a hegemonic position without him, Kohl saw a common currency as a necessity for securing the European project. The fact that leading politicians saw what was to become the Euro as a political instead of an economic project also explains why Italy became a. founding member, despite its fundamentals being obviously not good enough. Weaker countries like Italy which wanted to join the Euro made a similar mistake as the “falling forward” proponents: Joining the Eurozone was partly motivated by a mistrust in the capability of the national government to conduct sound economic policies The membership in the currency union was supposed to force national politicians to address fundamental problems (Euro as “external anchor”)., although this again underestimates the difficulty of implementing reforms under economic and social stress. Nevertheless, a correlation between the wish for more Eurozone coordination and domestic reforms can be seen in some countries even today.

      <p>
        Despite Kohl’s attempt to use his political capital after the German unification and shut down public debate around the introduction of the Euro, there were a lot of discussions about the project and its schedule. Italy and France pushed for 1999 as final date for the creation of the Eurozone and weakened the accession criteria to get there. Instead of meeting certain thresholds (such as for inflation or the debt ratio), now a movement towards those thresholds should be sufficient. Moreover, to keep their deficits below 3% as agreed upon (see below) the German government sold shares of the German Telecom while the French government got a special payment from French telecom and in return took on some of their pension obligations. They were not only motivated by their political goals, but also by economic justifications that had been found by scholars. On the micro level, the Euro was supposed to lower transaction costs and to bring efficiency gains through higher price transparency and tougher competition. On the macro level, the abolishment of exchange rate realignments should reduce uncertainty for cross-country trade and investments. At the time, these arguments were relatively new and not yet empirically studied. A study by Frankel and Rose in 2002, however, predicted a miraculous expansion of intra-European trade of up to 300% (which of course never happened).
      </p>
      <p>
        An at the time well settled theory was the theory of optimal currency areas (OCA), founded by Robert Mundell in 1961. It describes the conditions under which a group of countries is suited to form a monetary union. Since monetary policy is set by a single central bank, the countries should have well synchronized business cycles so that the common interest rate fits all economies. In case of asymmetric shocks (country A gets a problem but country B does not) flexible wages and prices as well as the movement of workers and capital should do the rebalancing. Peter Kenen later added a centralized budget as another shock absorber, a point which we will discuss in greater detail below. Those criteria imply lower costs from forming a monetary union, while the benefits are mainly determined by the amount of trade between member states. Before 2000, the Eurozone did not do particularly well with regard to those criteria. Consequently, a new idea was laid out: the endogeneity of OCA hypothesis. Even if the Eurozone was not yet an OCA, it was supposed to become one over time thanks to the common currency fostering trade and economic integration. The pessimistic counterpart of this story came from Paul Krugman and Barry Eichengreen: In a monetary union, countries would specialize more to maximize gains from trade, thereby getting more dissimilar and more vulnerable to asymmetric shocks. Needless to say, European politicians choose to be optimistic.

        While Mitterrand and Kohl were pretty proud after signing the Maastricht treaty defining the Euro framework, both the French and the German public were not enthusiastic. While French newspapers complained about the final victory of the D-Mark, the German press moaned its end. But what was is that policy makers created in Maastricht? While there are of course many important elements, I want to focus on the overall framework for fiscal policy and for monetary policy. When countries share a common currency, it is clear that they need at least some rules so that no country can exploit others by printing money and using it to import other countries’ goods without consequences. However, there were two competing concepts regarding the design of those fiscal rules. Germans tend to favour a combination of some strict rules and market mechanisms (the foundation of Ordoliberalism) and emphasize individual responsibility and accountability. If a country gets into trouble, it should get out of it by implementing reforms. They care a lot about incentives and moral hazard (an incentive to take on more risk because of limited liability). While for Germans it is most important that strict rules prevent crises from happening, French politicians tend to focus more on the flexibility needed in case a crisis happens. Also, they see strict constraints on governments as undemocratic and favour symmetric adjustments (i.e., some sort of cost sharing). But to everyone’s surprise, it was the French that proposed the toughest fiscal rule design: While Germans put forward a strict golden rule (a hard limit on budget deficits with exemptions for investment, something that progressive reforms now would like to include), the French wanted to avoid resistance from fiscal conservatives with a 3% limit on total deficits (of both federal and local budgets in a member state). Why 3%? The political answer is that France’s deficit at the time was slightly lower, and Mitterrand wanted a reason to refuse more spending; the economic justification invented later was that a permanent 3% deficit is the budget balance compatible with a stable debt-to-GDP ratio at 60% when nominal growth equals 5%. This threshold becomes even stricter if one wants to do countercyclical fiscal policy, because then the deficit needs to keep a safety distance to the 3% in good or normal times. In 2005, this principle even made it into the euphemistically called Stability and Growth Pact in form of medium-term budgetary object (MTO), which adds a 0.5-1% limit to the structural deficit (the deficit without cyclical components). Needless to say, the Germans eagerly agreed since this rule follows the Ordoliberal formula: Firstly, it gives a clear limit for total deficits. Secondly, if one divides total deficit into primary deficit plus interest payments and lets market determine the interest rate, then market mechanisms decide on the fiscal space of a country – the root of the Eurocrisis. The idea of markets as disciplinary forces is also the reason for not issuing bonds collectively so that each country has to “convince” markets to buy their bonds on their own. This was actually a regress, since even the High Authority of Coal and Steel from 1950 did issue common bonds for investment. It also ignored previous evidence on market forces, as laid out in the Delors Report of 1989:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “Experience suggests that market perceptions do not necessarily provide strong and compelling signals and that access to a large capital market may for some time even facilitate the financing of economic imbalances. Rather than leading to a gradual adaptation of borrowing costs, market views about the creditworthiness of official borrowers tend to change abruptly and result in the closure of access to market financing. The constraints imposed by market  forces might either be too slow and weak or too sudden and disruptive. Hence countries would have to accept that sharing a common market and a single currency area imposed policy constraints.”
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, that’s exactly what happened later. At least, the founding members agreed on an escape clause for the rather harsh rules to give some leeway during crises, but they also upheld the principle of individual responsibility with a triple ban: no bail-out (helping another country repaying their debt), no monetization (no creation of new money to pay back governments’ debt by central banks), and no debt restructuring (a country is not allowed to default on parts of its debt).
      </p>
      <div id="4" >
      </div>
      <p>
        The second important pillar of the Maastricht framework is the design of the central bank. Following the Bundesbank model and the monetarist trend at the time, the ECB was granted a previously unseen amount of independence: Not only are its leaders elected for eight years without re-election, they are also not formally accountable to other European institutions. The ECB has been given price stability as single mandate and is allowed to interpret this objective as it seems fit (recently, the ECB switched from “close to but below 2%” to “on average 2% in the medium term”) as well as to choose the instruments to achieve it. After the experience with the EMS, politicians must have known that this arrangement cannot work: If the ECB is confronted with diverging inflation dynamics but only has one interest rate for the whole Eurozone at hand, then those dynamics are reinforced. The same nominal interest rate implies a lower (and therefore more expansionary) real interest rate for countries with high inflation and vice versa, a problem which becomes even bigger with the entrance of poorer countries with catch-up inflation (due to the Balassa-Samuelson effect). Although the lack of a fiscal counterpart strengthens the role of the ECB, it also makes its job much harder. The ECB has so much independence that even central banking hawk Paul Volcker considered it to be too much, while the famous MIT-economists Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani critized the ECB’s single mandate for ignoring the necessary weighting of the effects of monetary policy against its consequences for the real economic.
      </p>
      <div id="5" >
      </div>
      <p>
        However, the combination of a dominant, inflation centred monetary policy and a very constrained fiscal policy was a deliberate choice since the whole framework reflects two main views: the German model and an incomplete OCA theory. The German model rests upon – as Erhard described it – “superior internal discipline”. Economic growth was not to be generated by Keynesian fiscal stimulus but was supposed to come from exports. The role of the Bundesbank was to keep inflation low and deter syndicates from rising wages too much, so that the real exchange rate improved favourably for German exporters. In bad times, Germany relied on structural reforms instead of monetary stimulus, which effectively also aimed at improving the situation for exporters. The obvious problem with this model is that it is a mercantilist beggar-thy-neighbour policy, which by definition cannot work for all countries – the surpluses of one country are the deficit of someone else. Interestingly, there was a popular hypothesis at the time of the Maastricht negotiations claiming that trade deficits were strongly driven by the fiscal balance. Strict fiscal rules, therefore, were also supposed to avoid trade imbalances. Even if this would be the case (and it is not), the focus on a balanced fiscal budget over the medium to long term forces a country to run trade surpluses if it wants its private sector to accumulate wealth. This follows from the sectoral balances perspective (by design, the sum of flows between government, private sector, and rest of the world are zero) and can be summarized in a sector balances map. As we can see, most European countries run trade surpluses, which is also a consequence of the reforms forced upon struggling countries in the Eurocrisis.
      </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/static/the-euro/Balances-Map.png"  class="plotly"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        The second strong influence on the Maastricht framework was OCA theory. The classical OCA theory as in Mundell 1961 focuses on permanent asymmetric shocks, for example a change in consumer demand away from products primarily produced in a certain country. In such a situation, politicians considered monetary policy or fiscal transfers to be useless. Instead, the respective country would need to restructure its economy by reforms and gain competitiveness through internal devaluation, i.e., wage reductions (OCA theory would also suggest other channels like labour mobility, although changing from one state to another is much more difficult in Europe than in the USA). While this argument in itself is questionable (e.g., if wages fall faster than prices, real wages decrease and domestic demand plunges), the more important aspect is that the Maastricht framework gave governments little at hand to deal with temporary shocks. As Peter Kenen had pointed out, a common budget with automatic transfers to countries experiencing a temporary asymmetric shock is very well suited to cushion such shocks. This was also known in Brussels, after the McDougall Report in 1977 had stated that a common budget of at least 5-7% of GDP would be necessary for a monetary union. But politicians and electorates were unwilling to transfer national fiscal resources to other member states, so that to this day the EU budget has a size of 1% of GDP and accounts only for 2% of all public expenditures in the EU. Milton Friedman got to the heart of the European problem in 1997:
      </p>
      <p quote="class">
        “Europe exemplifies a situation unfavourable to a common currency.  It is composed of separate nations, speaking different languages, with different customs, and having citizens feeling far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to a common market or to the idea of Europe.”
      </p>
      <div id="6" >
      </div>
      <p>
        Effectively, the politicians in Maastricht had built a shaky house on swampy ground, and a crisis was only a matter of time. Ironically, the first country that rebelled against the Maastricht framework was Germany. After the unification, Germany became the sick man of Europe, and Gerhard Schröder got increasingly frustrated by the ECB not lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy and complained about its undemocratic nature. To be able to do more fiscal stimulus, German finance minister Hans Eichel first called for a SGP reform and then simply ignored the 3% rule of the Maastricht pact in an alliance with France. Again ironically, it was Italian president of the Commission Prodi who wanted to impose sanctions on them but was powerless against the two biggest countries of the Eurozone. To bring the budget deficit back down, Schröder in accordance with syndicates and employers’ associations bet on the standard German recipe: superior internal discipline. By keeping wages low and creating the biggest low-paid sector in Europe, Germany decreased its real exchange rate and increased its competitiveness. It is the same trick as devaluation: By inducing lower inflation, German goods become cheaper relative to that of its European neighbours and, thanks to the stable Euro, relative to international trading partners. This of course harmed the rest of the Eurozone, of which Schröder was well aware: “If it was France's wish to create the euro in order to break Germany's supposed dominance, exactly the opposite has happened. As German competitiveness has increased, Germany stands stronger, not weaker. In a way, this is logical and also inevitable, because we are the strongest economy in Europe - and the others can no longer devalue.” This egoism is even more shameless, as the German program could only work because the rest of Europe created a growth-supportive environment by stabilizing demand for goods. This was very different from the Eurocrisis, where Germany forced Greece to rely on exports but also drained demand for goods in the whole Eurozone trough the enforcement of a contractionary fiscal policy regime. Also, internal devaluation brings the same problem as exchange rate devaluation, namely that debt becomes more difficult to serve, which was a bigger problem for Greece than Germany at the time. It is actually incomprehensible why the founding fathers of the Eurozone did nothing to ensure the coordination of wage policies. Firstly, wage growth relative to productivity growth (i.e., unit labour costs) matters a great deal for inflation. If every country is supposed to have 2% inflation, it should increase its nominal wages by 2% plus productivity growth each year. Secondly, both OCA theory and Eurocrisis programmes see wage adjustments as an important tool to address asymmetric shocks. But when wages should (relatively) go down in a country that experiences an asymmetric shock, then they should decrease in some country during normal times, because this obviously creates imbalances. The scoreboard of the later introduced European Semester (discussed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.naive-economics.com/unattraktivster-sixpack-der-welt">here</a>) does recognize this issue, but only aims at constraining too high wage growth, not too low. However, European firms should compete about who is the most productive and most innovative, not who is able to pay workers the lowest salaries. While the general logic of those arguments still holds, it is worth noting that in our new times, competitiveness on the national level will for quite some time probably more depend on energy prices than on wages. This means that building cheap renewables is a new important source of economic advantage, making the competition for it much more useful. At the same time, energy prices will continue to strongly affect inflation dynamics, making the price stability mandate of the ECB impossible to fulfil without help from other institutions. Additionally, one should not forget that climate protection is a public good, so there is also a strong case for not letting member states alone with their energy transformation but investment jointly in the projects with the highest impact.

        Besides insufficient coordination of economic policies like those concerning wages, another central problem of the Eurozone are destructive capital flows. Since a common currency fixes nominal exchange rates, they cannot act as an automatic stabilizer. Without a monetary union, large capital inflows in a country lead to an appreciation of its currency due to the increased demand at the foreign exchange market, which makes buying this currency and investing in the respective country less attractive. In a monetary union, on the contrary, capital inflows stimulate the economy and push up incomes without altering the exchange rate. In this situation, it becomes very attractive to lend even more money to this country, because rising incomes there enable borrowers to pay back their loans more easily, as the induced inflation reduces real interest rates. This leads to a dangerous spiral of more capital inflows (mostly short-term credit), higher inflation, lower interest rates, and more borrowing, which often fuels housing price bubble, as it happened in Spain. Fiscal rules are useless here since they only look at public borrowing and neglect private debt. Financial markets were supposed to identify such erroneous developments and react accordingly, but exactly as the Delors Report had warned, they just further poked the fire. When the great financial crises hit in 2008, it sent financial markets into a state of shock and awe, so that capital flows in the European south suddenly stopped. Now a new problem overlooked by the Euro’s architects took centre stage: the sovereign-bank doom loop. In the Eurozone, the fate of national governments and national banks are intertwined. If the economy plunges and the government’s budget gets into trouble, its bonds loose value (i.e., the interest rate they have to pay on new loans rises). Since domestic banks are large buyers and holders of such bonds, this hurts their solvency and can cause them a lot of damage. On the other side, if banks get into trouble and buy much less (or sell) government bonds, they can cause even a prudent government to pay higher interest rates and run into excessive deficits. Also, European companies depend much more on banks for their financing as it is the case in the USA (where they raise much more capital at the equity market). The banks are well aware of those mechanisms, which is part of the reason why they invest so much into domestic bonds. As a consequence of those doom loops, sudden stops of capital going to the private sector increase interest rate for both the private and the public sector. As economist Paul de Grauwe put it: “The move from a pegged exchange rate system to a monetary union displaced the source of instability from the foreign exchange market to the national government bond markets.” The higher interest rates governments have to pay, the more likely it is that they have to increase their cyclical spending and, in the end, may default on their debt, making markets even more reluctant to buy their bonds. This last problem could have been avoided if the Maastricht framework had made the ECB a lender of last resort to both banks and governments. In such a case (as in all other countries with their own currency), markets cannot speculate on governments becoming insolvent, so that a sudden stop crisis does less likely evolve into a debt crisis. The dynamic of self-fulfilling prophecies haunts the Eurozone to this day: As the below figure by Pierre Aldama shows is the debt accumulation of countries like Portugal, Spain, or Greece to a large extent driven by this factor.

        Because the Greek bar looks a bit different and because the Greek crisis is a good object of study for many of the mistakes mentioned before, we should briefly visit the Athenian tragedy. The case of Greece is unique insofar, as it was the only country having a solvency problem. While Spain or Portugal went into the crisis with pretty low debt levels and only got into temporary liquidity problems because of the above-described mechanism, Greek governments had actually accumulated too much debt and, even worse, had lied about the true size of their deficits. Governments in Athens were notorious for their corruption and mismanagements long before it joined the Euro. Already in the 1970s, Greece wanted to be part of the EEC (European Economic Community) because it wanted an external anchor. But instead of improving their policies, they took advantage of the EEC, for example by taking assistance loans when Greece struggled in 1985 but ignoring the reform conditions attached. However, when the crisis unfolded in 2010, it was not the time to play the blame game. It was obvious to everyone that Greece could not handle the amount of debt it owed and judging from past experiences of the IMF in other countries, a financial rescue package in combination with debt restructuring and political reforms would have been the right way. But there were two problems: Firstly, European politicians wanted to handle the crises themselves but were unwilling to grant fiscal transfers, so that financial aid packages were always too little, too late. Moreover, this aid came in the form of loans which at the beginning had an interest rate attached of 5% and should be paid back within seven years. These conditions were later softened, and part of the debt forgiven, but they speak volumes about the mindset of the European “partners”. Secondly, while debt restructuring sounds good, it is nothing else than a partial default and this was no option (remember the triple ban). Not even Merkel and Sarkozy, in a brief moment of sanity, could push through a partial bail-in of private investors and got fierce resistance from then ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet. Yet again ironically, Trichet was a French central banker who went full Bundesbank style, for example by infamously hiking interest rates in July 2008 and fantasizing about dangers of inflation throughout the great financial crisis. Because it was not allowed to restructure its debt, Greece had to use most of the rescue packages to pay back private investors. A 2016 study by the ESMT (https://faculty-research.esmt.berlin/publication/where-did-greek-bailout-money-go) estimates that of the 220 billion € sent to Greece since the beginning of the crisis, 140 billion € (!) went to creditors and only 10 billion € entered the regular budget to possibly reach Greek households. When debt restructuring became inevitable and finally happened in 2012, it was too late to save the Greek economy. The reform packages forced upon the Greek economy were further evidence for the lack of solidarity of European partners, since they included things like the elimination of fresh milk labels (which made it easier for foreign companies to steal market shares from local farmers) or the auctioning of real assets, like a bunch of regional airports which were acquired for a cheap price by German Fraport. The biggest damage, however, was done by the austerity program that was supposed to bring the German model to Greece. A massive reduction in public expenditure (which resulted in the impoverishment of pensioners and other transfer recipients) and real wages killed all internal demand and sent Greek GDP into a downward spiral from which is has still not recovered. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2017/02/07/Greece-Ex-Post-Evaluation-of-Exceptional-Access-Under-the-2012-Extended-Arrangement-Press-4463">2017 assessment</a> of its involvement in the Greek crisis, the IMF came to a crushing conclusion: the required spending cuts were too harsh, the stimulating effect of expenditures had been massively underestimated, assumed export price elasticities were unrealistically high (so that wage cuts did not stimulate export sufficiently), and they could not find evidence for a positive impact of the enforced structural reforms. Both the Eurozone’s framework and its leaders were simply unfit to deal with the crisis.

        Europe and the Euro countries have come a long way, but as we have seen, they cannot stay where they are. Living in an unsafe house, one either has to move out or repair the building. The dissolution of the Eurozone is not really an option, due to the huge uncertainty regarding potential costs and the high approval rating the Euro has among European electorates. While its reputation was severely damaged during the Eurocrisis, its supporters are today the clear majority in every single Euro country.
      </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/static/the-euro/Public-Support.png"  class="plotly"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        One can speculate whether this increasing support stems from the reforms undertaken and innovations or simply from the desire of staying in a close-knit group of countries in a more and more unstable world, but in any case, this is an important opportunity. Since reforms towards more integration are only possible when electorates back the European project, the Euro area now needs to make some bold steps forward to fix central problems. As we have seen again and again, the monetary union needs to be completed with a political union. One important element of this is the fiscal union, i.e., the integration of fiscal policy, mainly through the creation of a common budget and a common debt instrument. The centralization of cyclical expenditures and revenues acts as an automatic stabilizer. The most popular example for this is the often-proposed European unemployment insurance: If transfer payments to the unemployed would be financed collectively, then a temporary increase in unemployment numbers in one country would automatically imply higher net transfers out of the common pool towards this country. Today, fiscal rules try to allow additional fiscal space for cyclical expenditures by assessing the structural budget balance. This is an estimation of the budget balance in a situation of a closed output gap (actual GDP = potential GDP). However, it is consensus among economists that the existing procedures to get to these numbers are deeply flawed, so that the estimated potential GDP is hardly better than a moving average of past real GDP, which excessively constrains fiscal space in bad times. If essential cyclical spending was done collectively, the need for such auxiliary means would be eliminated and rules for federal budgets could be made much clearer (and, if one wishes, tighter). The Eurozone would then finally make progress with regard to sharing asymmetric risks.

        There are two political obstacles. On the one hand, conservatives often warn against the dangers of moral hazard. If countries would not need to bear the burden of too much unemployment, they would have no incentive for implementing reforms and improving the situation at the labour markets. While this may be a justified in some policy areas, the argument is weaker when it comes to cyclical spending. In general, voters do want to have a job and do want to see their country or region prosper, regardless of the fiscal burden of unemployment. On the other hand, it is obvious that one cannot go so far as letting individual countries still decide on the design of centrally funded programs (here the moral hazard problem become clearly too big). Therefore, commonly financing a program requires commonly deciding its design (e.g., the amount of unemployment benefits), a big transfer of sovereignty. Again, this is less problematic for cyclical spending since national preferences probably do not differ much here. Nevertheless, it does require democratic reforms to give people a say in such decisions and legitimize them on the European level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Less democratic challenges would be caused by another essential element of a fiscal union, namely joint debt issuance. The creation of a common bond backed by all member states would serve multiple purposes. It would make every country pay the same interest rates on its debt and finally put an end to interest rate spreads. As we have seen, those spreads are often not connected to fundamentals but driven by market exuberance. They not only unfairly lead to different fiscal space for governments, but also disturb the transmission of monetary policy because the ECB can no longer steer long term interest rates for all countries. Moreover, government bonds are an important benchmark for corporate bonds, too, so that bond spreads lead to different financing conditions for companies depending on their location, which distorts competition. Importantly, the common interest rate would be relatively low compared to current interest rates (although perhaps slightly higher for safe havens like Germany), because a Eurozone bond would be effectively backed by the ECB, making it as riskless as a US-bond and preventing insolvency speculations. Additionally, a common bond would considerably increase the stability of the banking sector because it would break the vicious doom loop previously described. Lastly, a common bond with a single interest rate implies turning away from using markets as disciplinary forces – in light of the evidence presented, surely another supportive argument (although there are many proposals combining common debt with national bonds so that markets still play a role).

        Besides the two instruments at the core of a fiscal union (a common budget and common debt), a political union must be more. While it is not necessary to directly leap to the United States of Europe, there must be more coordination of economic policies in at least some areas. As we have seen, a common wage policy is necessary both to achieve the inflation target and to create a level playing field for firms. Needless to say, governments for the most part cannot directly influence wages, but they create the framework in which wage bargaining takes place (which is one reason why more tax harmonization is also needed). With regard to existing imbalances, it is clear that it is unfair to solely force reforms upon some countries, for example those with a current account deficit. In a monetary union with intertwined economies, there are huge spillover effects from all national policies and imbalances are usually created collectively, which is why surplus countries need to contribute to counter measures, too. For example, after Germany had pushed its net exports to new heights by restraining wages (thereby creating deflationary pressure), it prescribed the same medicine for countries hit by the Eurocrisis. But if everybody reduces wages, then there are not competitive gains (only deflation and demand shortages). Instead, Germany should have increased wages itself. European politicians must aim at creating a feeling of unity, so that it becomes natural for both politicians and electorates to take other Euro members’ state into account. The Euro’s fate depends less on correcting its economic flaws and much more on achieving this political task. To create a sense of unity, especially among groups that have been dismissive of the Euro (partly because of the problems it created, partly because they blamed it for global trends like globalization), we need policies targeting them and being visibly European. The European Commission expects own revenues of 17 billion € annually from already planned new sources (emission trading, CBAM, minimum corporate tax) and wants to use this money to repay joint debt issued for the Next Generation EU program. With the above objective in mind, it should instead invest it in social programs and make sure to advertise them as European (NGEU debt can be rolled over like all public debt or just be monetized through the ECB). NGEU is an important program, but expenditures financed from it will be perceived as national – a political mistake. In the future, when a fiscal union will have increased fiscal space sufficiently to tackle the green transformation and digitization as well as strengthening the social safety net in Europe, this mistake should not be repeated, Europeans need to see what Europe does for them (which does not mean that spending decision should not be made federally, in fact local bodies should be much more involved).
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently there is not only a window of opportunity for more integration because of the strong public support for the Euro, but also because we need to find answers to multiple crises inside and outside of Europe. As Jean Monnet famously put it in 1961, “Europe will be forged in crises and will be  the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” This is by no means a European characteristic: While the USA followed a different integration path beginning with a fiscal union over a single market and banking union to at the very end implementing a monetary union (while for Europe it would be: single market, monetary union, banking union, fiscal union), it still required multiple crises and two centuries to complete the economic and political union. The creation of a fiscal union, for example, was only possible during the civil war, when financing the war efforts became an existential challenge for the Northern states. Only then, they introduced taxation on the national level, a federally controlled legal tender, and common debt issuance. The big question, of course, is how Europe can move in the same direction without a war-like event (one could argue that climate change does also pose an existential thread to humankind, but one has to acknowledge the fact that people apparently are not sufficiently in panic because of this). What we can learn from US history and Abraham Lincoln is that, as Historian Richard Hofstader put it, “the vital test of a democracy is economic”. Lincoln was well aware that political progress needs a material basis. This is why Europe needs to start investing more in its social fabric and connect this investment with concepts of European identity and European integration. Needless to say, these investments take time to produce results, and we cannot leave the Eurozone architecture in its current state until we are able to do a general reconstruction. Instead, multiple changes are needed now: The fiscal rules must be revised to make them less countercyclical and to create more fiscal space (<a target="_blank" href="www.zoe-institut.de/en/publication/an-analysis-of-the-feasibility-and-impact-of-proposals-for-reforming-fiscal-policy-in-the-eu/">here</a> very good overview over proposals), the Recovery and Resilience Facility should be perpetuated and complement the current EU budget, and the ECB get support for its announced anti-fragmentation tool against bond spreads – to name just a few important elements. However, these reforms would not address the fundamental problem of insufficient political integration and would leave the monetary union still incomplete. That is why we must keep the long-term goal always in mind and start to work towards it. The perfect time is now.

      <h2 class="title">Economics for the current Crisis</h2>
      <p>
      Times of crisis are always also times of uncertainty. And seldom has overall uncertainty been higher than in the current polycrisis: How much damage comes from supply chains disrupted by Corona? How will commodity markets react to the ongoing Ukraine crisis? Which welfare losses result from the increasing energy costs or even an energy import boycott against Russia? All of these questions are of high significance but very difficult to answer. So, what can economists contribute in this situation? What can we learn from the economic literature? The following article aims at presenting two research projects that deal with questions of high relevance for today, both with regard to their findings and their academic approach. While the former is hopefully interesting for anyone, the latter is mainly targeted at people who want to understand how economic research is actually done. However, such an understanding is in general very important for interpreting and handling research results appropriately – and it is often missing in the bureaus of media agencies. Therefore, I hope the following gives a better feeling for what economic research actually looks like and how to handle results from econ academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both presented papers are related to the current oil and gas price crisis, but they are written from very different perspectives: The first one studies the distribution of welfare losses caused by higher energy prices between consumers and producers in various U.S. industries with plant-level data (<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180474" target="_blank">Ganapati et al. 2020</a>); the second one uses a theoretical model of the macroeconomy to estimate potential GDP losses from an import boycott against Russia (<a href="https://www.econtribute.de/RePEc/ajk/ajkpbs/ECONtribute_PB_028_2022.pdf" target="_blank">Bachmann et al. 2022</a>). The papers differ in two main ways: Firstly, the former studies partial equilibrium effects, while the latter looks at general equilibrium effects. The partial equilibrium view focuses on a single event in a single market and assumes that everything outside of this market does not change (the “ceteris paribus” condition). Contrary to that, the general equilibrium looks at the big picture and allows for all prices and quantities to react to a shock over time. Secondly, the former paper is mainly empiric (i.e., it analyses data to identify causal relationships), while the latter is mainly theoretical (i.e., it runs calculations with certain parameter values to estimate effects). However, we will see that this distinction is not as clear as one might think.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we start, here is a quick roadmap: In the <a href="#1">first half</a>, I will introduce the paper by Ganapati et al. 2020 and explain its econometric strategy, before describing their results and comparing them to the current gasoline prices in Germany (this whole part is heavily based on a recent <a href="./static/learning-from-econ-academia/Discussion of Ganapati et al 2020 - Florian Frühhaber.pdf" target="_blank">seminar paper</a> by me, which also includes more technical details); in the <a href="#2">second half</a>, we will look at a much-discussed paper by Bachmann et al. 2022, with a special focus on the role of substitution elasticities and the model’s limiting assumptions. Lastly, I summarize the main take-aways.

      <h3> The Energy Cost Pass-Through in U.S. Manufacturing </h3>
      <p>
      All of the current crises from Corona over Ukraine to climate change have a clear impact on productions costs and overall prices, both short-term (e.g., current oil and gas price hikes) and long-term (carbon pricing as environmental policy). Therefore, it is crucial to understand how firms pass on increasing production costs to consumers (so-called “pass-through”). Here, an interesting aspect coming up in many recent inflation debates is the role of competition: Do firms with market power shift more welfare burden to consumers, i.e., do they adjust prices stronger in reaction to increasing marginal costs – potentially even increasing their profits in the process? Certainly an interesting question (that will be answered), but let’s start with the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
      Both the behaviour of firms (setting prices) and consumers (adjusting demand to prices) determine overall welfare effects. With the word “welfare” economists try to capture the actual well-being or aggregated utility of people, often expressed in monetary terms.  Welfare is, therefore, a theoretical concept and requires a theoretical foundation. The most common concept is that of consumer surplus (aggregated difference between maximum willingness to pay and actual price paid for all buyers) and producer surplus (aggregated difference between production costs, equivalent with minimum willingness to sell, and actual selling price for all sellers). Graphically, this is represented by the areas between the horizontal price line and the demand or supply curve (equivalent to the marginal costs curve) in a price-quantity-diagram. Increasing production costs shift the supply curve upwards, in the case of an output tax by the total amount of the tax (think of an output tax of 1€ as a 1€ increase in unit costs for the firms). However, when the price for inputs such as oil rises (be it due to a tax or due to a Russian dictator), firms can respond to that price change by altering their production process in such a way to reduce oil usage. In this case, the firm’s unit costs rise by less than the total tax, which makes input taxes very different from output taxes. The degree of substitutability determines the firm’s demand elasticity: The firm’s demand for an input is completely inelastic if it cannot substitute away from it (think of oil refineries and oil). If this is the case for all inputs, we call this a Leontief-technology. Therefore, the effect of rising input prices on production costs depends on the industry and has to be empirically estimated separately per industry. The pass-through of the production cost increases to unit prices is determined by two main factors. Firstly, the general price setting strategy of the firm: It is common knowledge that a firm in a competitive market acts very differently from a monopolistic or oligopolistic firm with market power. Secondly, since prices are linked to quantities supplied, the behaviour of the firms depends on its supply elasticity. When it is very expensive for a firm to change the quantity of their output, they react less to market price fluctuations and have a very inelastic supply. Taking all of this together, the authors of the paper derive a formula for incidence (which is a measure of the change in consumer surplus relative to the change in producer or total surplus, i.e., a measure for relative welfare effects) containing three variables they have to estimate:
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:1.6rem;">
      \(I = {\rho_{MC} \over 1-(1-L \cdot \epsilon_D) \cdot \rho_{MC} }  \)
      </p>
      <p>
      \( \rho_{MC} \) is the pass-through of marginal costs changes (here due to input price changes) on prices (depending both on substitutability of the respective input and the overall output elasticity), L is the Lerner-Index (a firm’s markup on marginal costs as a measure of its market power), and \( \epsilon_D \) is the elasticity of demand. By theoretically varying the Lerner-Index, the authors calculate incidence for various market structures. However, an apparent flaw of this methods is the fact that the pass-through probably depends on the market power of the firm, so that holding the pass-through rate constant while varying the Lerner-Index produces biased estimates. Nevertheless, using estimated values for all three parameters promises interesting results. As a first step towards that, one needs marginal costs for calculating the Lerner-Index and the pass-through rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you estimate marginal costs? That’s the neat part, you don’t. In fact, the authors use two different approaches, one using markups and one using instruments. Markups are the difference (in absolute or relative terms) between the price of a good and its marginal production cost. Therefore, you can calculate marginal costs when you know a firm’s markups and unit prices (prices are in the data). The more market power a firm has, the higher markup it can impose on the consumers. However, the profit maximizing markup depends on the consumers’ demand elasticity, so that \( L = {1 \over \epsilon_D } \), which again shows that both producers’ and consumer’ traits are important. As it turns out, one can derive a formula which gives you a firm’s markup only by looking at the output elasticity with respect to material inputs and the expenditures of the firm on that input (see the linked seminar paper). Since this output elasticity is the answer to the question “How much does output change when the firms use 1% more materials?”, one can derive it by simply regressing output on material inputs , controlling for all other inputs and productivity. As always, the devil lies in the detail, because to control for productivity the authors must assume a certain production function, which makes the derived parameter values less reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To safeguard the analysis against measurement errors stemming from that, the authors use a second approach for getting marginal costs, namely instrumental variables. The main idea is very straightforward: When you want to study the effect of a variable x on a variable y, but cannot do it either due to measurement problems regarding x or due to endogeneity problems (such as simultaneity, when x affects y, but y also affects x), all you need to do is find a variably z (the instrument) that (1) influences y through changes in x, but has (2) no other correlation with y. In our case, we need to find an instrument for marginal costs to study the relationship between marginal costs and prices. So, what influences marginal costs but has no correlation with output prices when production costs do not change? The authors suggest energy prices: Firms use energy and fuels as input in their production process, so it makes sense that energy prices correlate with marginal costs (the relevance criterium (1)). And at first glance, it also sounds implausible that a firm whose costs are not affected by fuel price changes (a software company, for example) should change the price they charge for their goods (the validity criterium (2)). However, some people (such as <a href="https://reason.com/2022/01/12/elizabeth-warren-blames-high-food-prices-on-grocery-chains-record-1-percent-profit-margins/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a>) argue that overall inflation induced by increasing energy prices provides a justification for firms to exercise their market power regardless of their production costs and to increase prices without deteriorating their customer relations (since consumers would only blame the price increase on general inflation or would get insensitive to price increases). If this was true, it would mean that there was an effect of energy prices on unit prices outside the production cost channel, implying a validity problem. Nevertheless, it is doubtable that this channel is quantitatively relevant in general, so that energy prices should work as an instrument for marginal cost changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two different channels in which fuel prices (the authors include coal, gas, and oil) could affect production costs: either directly as production inputs, or indirectly when electricity generation in a state or country relies on the respective fuel, so that fuel price fluctuations change electricity prices. The authors construct an instrument for each of those channels by interacting the fuel price with either the share of input expenditures of a firm (direct instrument) or the share of this fuel in the electricity mix of the firm’s home state (indirect instrument). To get the replacement values for the explanatory variable of interest x, one regresses x on the instrument z and retrieves the predicted values for x (usually denoted as \( \hat x \)). In a second step, one regresses the dependent variable of interest y on those predicted values \( \hat x \) to study the causal relationship between x and y (to be precise, one actually estimated a local average treatment effect of z-induced changes in x on y). This is the 2SLS (two-stage least squares) regression method. The first stage (reg x on z) also serves as a test for relevance since you can read the strength of the correlation between x and z out of the regression results. One can see how this works out in practice by looking into the discussed paper: Regressing marginal costs on the direct instrument (fuel input channel, Table 4) gives significant coefficients for their relationship, while regressing marginal costs on the indirect instrument (electricity price channel, Table 3) only produces a significant effect for gas. This is because oil does not play a significant role in electricity production, so that the interaction of oil prices and electricity generation is a bad instrument for marginal costs. And there is another problem with the direct instrument: Since it looks at industries aggregated over the U.S., it does not exploit differences in fuel prices between states (when studying the relationship between two variables, you always want a lot of fluctuations, otherwise you cannot identify comovement well). Despite all these flaws regarding both marginal cost estimations and the instrumental variables, there is a comforting result: The final pass-through estimations do not vary greatly between the different methods. To get those pass-through estimates, which quantify the effect of marginal cost changes on unit prices, one simply regresses unit prices on estimated markups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the authors only need values for the demand elasticities to apply the above-described formula. Since demand elasticities are the answer to the question “How much does demand change when the product price increases by 1%?”, they again just have to regress quantity sold on unit prices. But there is a problem: Output quantity and prices suffer from the simultaneity problem already mentioned. Higher prices incentivize producers to increase their supply to make more money (demand effect), while an increase in supply also leads to lower prices (supply effect). Therefore, a naïve regression, falsely assuming a clear direction of causality, does not help. Luckily, it was exactly this problem for which the instrumental variable approach was invented. We can isolate the supply effect running from quantities to prices, by instrumenting output sold with productivity. Is this instrument relevant? Yes, because higher productivity leads to higher output. Is this instrument valid? Yes, because demand changes are not in any way correlated with productivity outside of this channel. For implementation, the authors first regress output on productivity (first stage), and then regress the predicted output values from the first stage on prices (second stage). This is done separately for each industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we look into the results, we need to get to know the data to which the described econometric techniques were applied. Unfortunately, this will lead to the discovery of additional analytical shortcomings, making the application of the results more difficult. One of those shortcomings stems from the fact that the data only covers six industries in the USA between 1972-1997. All those industries (boxes, bread, cement, concrete, gasoline, plywood) produce homogenous goods mostly used as inputs in other industries. While it is  - under additional assumptions - principally possible to estimate consumer welfare effects by looking at intermediaries’ markets, it is unclear whether pass-through rates differ between homogenous and heterogenous goods. For example, in markets with heterogenous goods, product differentiation is an important source of market power (think of Apple iPhone vs Samsung Galaxy). Also, most of these six industries are relatively similar with regard to their energy inputs, even though we have already stated that more variation on the data is better for studying causal links. As a sidenote, current data would entail higher energy price fluctuations because today’s energy market prices are determined by the marginal cost of production (“How expensive was the production of the last, i.e., the most expensive, unit of energy?”), while in the sample period energy markets were tighter regulated, so that the market price was more or less equivalent to the average costs (which are usually below and more stable than marginal costs in energy markets). All in all, the quality of the available data increases overall uncertainty regarding the external validity (applicability) of the results to other industries, time periods, and countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we finally come to the paper’s findings. Luckily, the authors sum up all their parameter estimations and incidence results in one handy table:
      </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/static/learning-from-econ-academia/incidence.png"  id="incidence"/>
        <p class="fig-desc">
          Source: Ganapati et al. (2020)
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
      Panel A shows the values for the parameters needed for the incidence formula per industry. Last things first, the Lerner-Indexes (between 0 for perfect competition and 1 for perfect monopoly) seem to make sense, since the highest value appears in the cement industry, which is in fact the most concentrated of these six (due to high fixed costs and high transportation costs). The demand elasticity is highest for bread and lowest for gasoline, representing the good substitutability of bread (there is lot of other food, just eat cake…) and the bad substitutability of gasoline in the short- to medium-run. The estimated pass-through rates also show big differences between the various products: When the marginal cost per unit increases by 1$, the gasoline price per unit increases only by 32ct for gasoline, while the unit price for boxes increases by 1.44$. The latter case implies that box producers take increasing production costs as an occasion or justification for price increases higher than the marginal cost rate, to gain higher profits. Another explanation could be that higher prices lead to much lower sale numbers, which causes increasing average costs, insofar there are positive economies of scale (unit costs fall with total quantity). A counterargument here could be that the demand elasticity for boxes is only modestly high.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the incidence results in Panel B yields interesting results: The depicted values show the share of total welfare losses that consumers have to bear are decreasing (!) with market power. The closer a market is to a perfect monopoly, the lower the share of welfare losses falling upon the consumer (note that this tells us nothing about whether absolute welfare losses for consumer are also lower). This seems counterintuitive at first glance, but since firms in a perfectly competitive market make less profits, they also have less “buffer-surplus” to bear welfare costs by themselves. In this case, the relative consumer share of welfare burden is higher, because firms have no other choice than to pass on the higher costs (or exit the market). However, as stated above, interpreting the numbers in such a way is highly speculative because they are generated under the assumption of constant pass-through, although is seems reasonable to assume that in reality the market structure plays a central role for determining pass-through. For example, a monopolist could decide not to increase prices a lot in reaction to higher production costs in order to keep potential competitors out of the market or not to lose to many customers in case of a very elastic demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        An aspect to always keep in mind when interpreting results is the uncertainty factor: One component of that is the significance level displayed by the standard errors in parentheses. As a rule of thumb, the estimated coefficients should at least be two times bigger than the standard error in absolute terms for significance at the 5% level. This is neither the case for any estimate in the gasoline industry, nor for most estimates for the perfect competition case. However, significance is far from a sufficient measure of uncertainty, especially in case of a multi-step mix of theory and empirics like in this paper. Nevertheless, the overall results suggest that (1) different industries have very different characteristics, which has important implications for welfare effects; (2) incidence is affected by many factors and heterogenous between industries; and (3) monopoly is in general a better approximation of the empirically observed incidence values (this is important, because economic models often assume perfect competition).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what can we learn from this paper for today? Going beyond the three learnings just listed, one needs to be very cautious. Take the current gasoline price hikes as an example: One could (but should not) take the numerical findings at their bare value and suggest that the rising oil prices only affect gasoline prices mildly, since the estimated pass-through rate was 0.32. If you did that and applied this pass-through rate to the producer price (before taxes) of petrol in Germany, you would severely underestimate the petrol price hikes.
      </p>

          Own Figure (<a href="/static/learning-from-econ-academia/oil and gasoline.xlsx" target="_blank">data</a>)
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
      However, you can use the general intuition of the paper’s analysis and ask what the actual pass-through rate for the period between January 4th and March 15th was: an astounding 2.36. This could indicate that refinery companies have taken advantage of the situation to increase their profit margin, or that the desire of European countries to substitute away from Russian imports led to strong local demand effects (e.g., for Norwegian refined oil). The former would imply that firms’ market power is very relevant, while in the latter case antitrust policy would not change a great deal. As this example shows, the practical impact of economic research sometimes stems less from the answers researchers give, but from the questions they make us ask. This is especially true when the econometric strategy is very complex and external validity not very high, as it is probably the case in this first paper discussed. Since one argument against directly picking up its numerical results lies in its partial equilibrium perspective described at the very beginning, we will now turn the second paper with a general equilibrium perspective.

      <h3> What if? The Economics Effects for Germany of a Stop of Energy Imports from Russia </h3>
      <p>
      At least in the German EconTwitter-Bubble, this paper (Bachmann et al 2022) has already legend status. It was a written by nine renowned economists within a very short period of time to provide an economic assessment for an urgent policy question: Should Germany (and the EU) stop all energy imports from Russia? To answer it, one must look at the potential costs for Germany as well as the potential benefits with regard to ending the war in the Ukraine. While the following paper only analyses the cost side, it should not go unmentioned that there exists also an intense debate about the benefits side (How leakproof is the freezing of accumulated Russian reserves? Does Russia really need imports in the short run? Are mercenaries paid in US-Dollar/Euro an important part of the Russian aggression?). Regarding the cost-side, the paper arrives at the surprising conclusion that a complete energy embargo against Russia would only lead to a 0.5%-3% GDP decline GDP in Germany (as comparison, the pandemic caused a 4.5% decline in 2020). Needless to say, this claim sparked a heated debate among academics and politicians, and turned German EconTwitter into a bullring. But it is not only because of the high policy relevance or the received attention that I want to roughly explain how the authors ran their analysis, but also because it tells us a lot about how macroeconomists think and work, and what we should do with their findings. Before we start a short disclaimer: First, I encourage you to actually read their paper, since they communicate their analysis very well for the broader public. Secondly, despite all the shortcomings discussed, one should appreciate how much effort these economists have put not only into making their analysis, but also into explaining, defending, and extending it afterwards. Thirdly, especially when it comes to the theoretical model used there are a lot of elements not even understood by top-tier scholars, let alone by an economics student like me. Nevertheless, even a relatively shallow analysis of the paper yields very interesting insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors start off by looking at the empirical data concerning Germany’s energy dependency on Russia. A staggering 30% of total primary energy usage in 2021 came from Russia, a number that climbs up to 55% for gas consumption. However, since then Germany has already reduced energy imports from Russia and multiple studies have proclaimed that it is possible to compensate at least some of the imports from Russia with other sources. Therefore, the authors estimate that in case of a total embargo Germany would lose 8% of its total energy supply (here it is already assumed that electricity production by gas is fully substituted by coal or nuclear power) and 30% of its gas. Additional German data is presented for approximating distributional effects, with two main findings: Firstly, households with a higher income devote a lower share of their total expenditures to energy purchases (3.6%), but this share is not completely different compared to the bottom 20% of the income distribution (4.9%). Secondly, the expenditure share is lower for households relying on gas heating, so that increasing gas prices would probably equalise the expenditure shares relative to household with oil heating, although at a higher level. Consequently, Bachmann et al. conclude that all households are affected by an energy supply shock, and because richer households can more easily cope with higher expenditures, they advise targeted transfer payments to low-income groups. All of this is pretty much consensus among economists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The controversies begin with another, very important empirical value: the elasticity of substitution. As we have already learned in the previous paper discussion, the elasticity of substitution describes how easily firms and households can compensate a price shock for one good by switching to another. This is closely correlated to the demand elasticity (How much less demand is there in case of a price increase?) and the authors often do not clearly distinguish the two. For example, gas power plants sometimes have an additional module which makes it possible to power the electricity generator with oil. Here, the elasticity of substitution (or of demand) would be quite high. On the other side, for households with a certain heating system, it is nearly impossible in the short term to switch to another energy source. Of course, in the medium to long term they could install another heating system, which shows that elasticities are very time depended. But the short-run demand elasticity is very low: Previous studies empirically estimated it at around 0.2 for gas, which would imply that a gas price increase by 10% would only lead to a 2% lower gas consumption in the short run (long-run elasticity estimations are around 0.6). For the industry sector, short term elasticity estimates for natural gas are also low, around 0.15-0.25. In their supplementary material, the authors highlight a crucial distinction with regard to the elasticity of substitution: While single industries may have short-term elasticities of or close to 0 (e.g., the chemical industry completely depends on gas), the elasticity of substitution for the whole economy is a very different concept. Imagine an extreme example, where 50% of all firms have an elasticity of substitution of 0 for gas, meaning that they cannot produce anything without gas (Leontief technologies), while the other 50% do not use gas at all. So, what happens when there is suddenly no more gas? If you said that 50% of total GDP would be lost, you would have fallen for the micro-to-macro fallacy. While it is true that the gas-dependent firms would exit the market, this would free a lot of resources (such as workers) that could partly be absorbed by existing or new industries (remember that we look at a general equilibrium where prices and quantities can change). Because of this effect, the loss in GDP would be lower than 50% and, therefore, the substitutability of gas for the whole economy higher than the average of all firms.
      </p>

        To illustrate the consequences of choosing different elasticities of substitutions, the authors approximate the whole economy with a simple production function Y=F(E,X) that produces output with two inputs (energy E being subject to an embargo as well as aggregated other inputs X) and has a constant elasticity of substitution (\( \sigma \)) between those two inputs (the higher, the easier it is to compensate for a fall in E). The relative importance of the inputs in the production process is captured by the parameter \( \alpha \) (the higher, the more important is E). The change in output Y caused by a fall in supply of E depends both on the importance (\( \alpha \)) and the substitutability of (\( \sigma \)) of the energy supply. Calibrating the production function to real-world data gives \( \alpha = 0.05 \) (however, the sensitivity to this parameter is quite low). The following figure from the paper’s appendix shows the output loss relative to energy supply reduction for this simple production function (read it mirror-inverted).

      Intuitively, in the extreme case of no overall substitutability (blue line) the output loss is equivalent to the energy reduction. However, even \( \sigma \) values close to zero (very low but existing overall substitutability) lead to a much minor output loss. This shows the importance of choosing the right elasticity. While the literature suggests an elasticity of substitution of 0.15-0.25 for the industrial sector, the authors take the conservative value of 0.1 in their much more complex model calculations.

        The complex model itself was developed by <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26108/w26108.pdf" target="_blank">Baqaee and Farhi (2021)</a> and used “off-the shelf”. Usually, economic models are built with a certain question in mind and tailored to the intended use, but because of the time pressure this was not possible here. The Baqaee-Farhi model was chosen because it features multiple countries each with multiple sectors to both incorporate cross-industry linkages and trading channels (e.g., substituting Russian gas with Norwegian gas). The main structure reflects an input-output matrix: For each national sector, it shows how many inputs come from each of the other national sectors as well as how much output is sold to each of them. The calibration is based on the World Input-Output Database (the latest release covers the years 2000-2014). As we have seen in the first paper discussed, welfare analyses are difficult because welfare is a slippery concept. For that reason, models like Baqaee-Farhi use GNE (gross national income) as a proxy for welfare, which is not ideal but at least better than GDP. Apropos “not ideal”, let’s talk about frictions. In economics, “frictions” are all those things that get in the way of the perfect market, such as imperfect information, trading costs, taxation, market power, irrationalities in financial markets – you name it. Of course, it is infeasible to account for each of these frictions separately (this would require a model as complex as the world), so Baqaee and Farhi represent all sort of frictions in one parameter that drives the price for seller and buyer apart. Think about it like a middleman between seller and buyer that puts a markup on the resale to the ultimate buyer (the higher this markup, the stronger the overall frictions). The only friction modelled explicitly is trading costs increasing with distance (iceberg trade costs). This and the abstract friction enables them to go beyond the case of perfect markets and also study suboptimal allocations. However, it is surely not enough to reflect frictions like distorted financial markets impeding the refinancing of struggling sectors, for example. This is one main criticism often brought up in debates around the estimated GDP costs of an energy embargo, while the other main criticism concerns the elasticities used.

      Although the authors stress that they consider the elasticities used to be very conservative, there is a big problem. As we have already seen in the first partial equilibrium paper, parameters that are estimated using data from “normal times”, where only modest shocks are present, can lead us astray in the study of exceptional shocks. For example, it is nearly impossible to say to what extent the used elasticities reflect cascading effects caused the shut-down of some industries. Indeed, even zero elasticity of substitution for some industries does not automatically imply close to zero elasticity overall, but how would the economy cope with the breakdown of industries producing intermediary goods (e.g., the chemical sector)? What other sectors came to a halt in this case? To what degree can imports ease the shortage of intermediate goods when other countries also suffer from energy supply shocks? As explained, the authors do use a complex multi-sector model that supposedly accounts for this, but they also explicitly state that changes in GNE only depend on the evolution of the share of GNE devoted to energy expenditures, so that “one can approximately ignore the economy’s input-output structure”. This does not really establish confidence in the model’s ability to deal with supply-chain problems. Regarding the appropriate elasticity values, however, the authors make an interesting point typical for macroeconomic thinking: To object to the use of zero elasticity values, where the aggregated industry could not cushion in any way the loss of energy supply and where output losses would be biggest (see figure above), they look at boundary conditions.  Namely, they point out that the use of zero elasticities in the model would imply that the marginal productivity of energy (“How much you can produce with one more unit energy?”) is equal to \( {1 \over \alpha } \), while the marginal productivity of other factors would be zero (i.e., you cannot produce anything without more energy). Then they assume perfectly competitive factor markets where the price of an input equals its marginal product and conclude that a consequent price of zero for non-energy inputs makes no sense – i.e., a zero elasticity of substitution makes no sense. While the elasticity of substitution for the whole economy is surely not zero, it is still noteworthy how they root their argument in abstract thinking, even though it boils down to saying “When energy is not substitutable, firms suffering a lack of energy would not pay a cent for other inputs”, which actually sounds pretty reasonable when you put it like this.

        A very commendable feature of the paper is the transparent mentioning of its assumptions and limitations. Importantly, the authors highlight that the model depicts a world where there are no additional disturbances from demand effects. Fiscal policy would perfectly cope with issues like rising unemployment following the decline in gas-intensive sectors and prevent second-round effects. For example, the government would hand out enough money to people losing their job or struggling with gas payments so that overall demand would be stabilized. At the same time, the central bank is supposed to control inflation more or less perfectly. The authors propose the standard recipe of higher interest rates, although this would further slowdown the economy and, crucially, hamper the costly turning away from gas, which requires favourable financing conditions for firms. These two assumptions regarding optimal policy choices suggest that the welfare losses would be higher in reality – not because politicians are bad at their job, but because achieving the assumed policy goals seems impossible. At this point, I should note that one of the authors ran some follow-up calculations in a New-Keynesian model incorporating demand effects and ended up with 1-2 percentage points higher GDP losses, but there is no related working paper out yet, so it is hard to judge how much better the model deals with those problems.

        It is evident that the paper by Bachmann et al. has multiple shortcomings, which comes as no surprise considering the difficult and complex question it deals with. So, what should we do with their results? For me, the biggest obstacle to answering this question is that the predictive accuracy of the Baqaee-Farhi model has not been tested yet (as far as I know) and using an untested model to predict the economic outcomes of an exceptional shock like a 30% loss of gas supply is, of course, pretty bold. That is why, in my opinion, the most important contribution of the paper was that it sparked a very vivid debate. And thanks to the transparent model with both its incorporated and left-out channels, the debate got automatically structured around these channels and thereby more fruitful. The numerical results, however, should probably be taken with more than just a grain of salt. But who knows, maybe President Putin will enforce a natural experiment for testing the estimates soon…

      <h3>What and how can we learn from economists?</h3>
      <p>
      After studying two very different papers linked to the current economic crisis, it may feel frustrating not to have some new, crystal clear truths and policy recipes at hand. However, you hopefully have a better sense for the way in which economists get to their results and conclusions. The critical assessment of the two approaches showed how many assumptions and techniques are necessary during the process and how big the underlying uncertainties really are. Therefore, policy makers and the public need to be very careful in interpreting economist’s results. Personally, I believe that in the end economics is a lot about story telling: Even after using the most sophisticated model, economists need to convince you with a story that makes sense. And to judge a story, one should never forget to ask the naïve questions.

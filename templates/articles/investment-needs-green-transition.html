      <h2 class="title">How much does the green transition cost?</h2>

        <p>By now, most people should have realized that climate change is both the most important force shaping this century as well as the biggest challenge for policy makers. The stakes are huge and so are the necessary changes. But just how big is the task in numbers – especially expressed in the most important political unit: dollars? In his Chartbook series <a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-carbon-notes-3-four-trillion" target="_blank">Adam Tooze put a $4 billion annual price tag</a> on sustainable development. However, other estimates floating around are sometimes lower and sometimes much higher. In this article, I want to sketch out how those numbers are derived, why they are so different across studies, and what they mean for policymakers. This story is about global mitigation expenditures, which aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Estimating adaptation needs is by no means simpler or less uncertain. In fact, one could make the case that we know much more about how to reduce emissions than about how bad climate change will be and how much adaption efforts it requires. However, as we will see, current estimates about adaption needs are pretty low – at least compared to mitigation needs. This means that including or excluding adaptation finance from the following summarizing graph does not really make a difference: </p>

    <div class="figure">

        <p class="fig-desc">

        </p>
      </div>


        <p>So, how came these values to be? The starting point of every study about climate policy requirements is choosing both a climate scenario and a policy objective. Usually, researchers either go for the Paris Agreement (limiting global warning to below 2°C and ideally to 1.5°C) or a Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) target for 2050. The next step is to calculate the remaining emissions budget or emissions path compatible with the policy objective. This is a difficult task since the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature increases is not linear. There is a high uncertainty around the right carbon budget, even more so because multiple emission paths can lead to the same temperature increase. This can be seen form the below figure by the NGFS. They all share one problem, however, namely that these scenarios do not take into account tipping points such as melting permafrost (although <a href=" https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/climate-change-banned-words/climate-tipping-point-real" target="_blank">some argue</a> that this is not too problematic for usual time horizons). In that regard, the estimates based on those emission budgets are by design rather "optimistic".</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/2 co2 paths.png" id="img2"/>
      </div>


        <p>Besides the choosing a climate target, studies differ in the extent to which other development goals are included. For example, the NZE scenario in IEA2021 (all studies referenced like this are in the dataset linked below the first figure) also achieves some of the UNs’ sustainable development goals (SDG), most notably the SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy for all). This implies a much-broadened access to energy grids in developing countries, increasing the investments necessary in the energy sector. Similarly, studies about the transformation of the agricultural sector take into account SDG 2 (zero hunger worldwide), again widening the scope of the challenge. In the end, basically all SDGs are directly related to fighting climate change, but few studies spell out what this implies for their scenarios. However, the Worldbank2019 report considers the additional infrastructure investments necessary for achieving the SDGs to be relatively small in comparison to climate financing needs, since most of the expenditures can be directly classified as climate mitigation or adaption. </p>
        <p>After having settled on where one wants to go, the central question is how to get there. To find an answer, there are two basic approaches. Most studies use a bottom-up approach, defining the sectors of interest and aggregating expert studies about necessary actions there. The by far most important sector is power generation, of course, but other parts of the energy sector (power grids, electrification, efficiency improvements) as well as different energy intensive industries (cement, steel, aluminium, chemicals), transport (roads, rails, shipping, aviation), and buildings (heating, construction) are also of high relevance. A sector that is often left out is AFOLU (agriculture, forestry, and other land use). The latest IPCC report references a study estimating respective investment costs of (much) below $500 billion (more on that later). In principle, the finer the categories and the more specific the referenced expert studies, the better. Of course, the number of sectors included is not the same across different reports. Because of the importance of the energy sector, the resulting discrepancies are significant, but not huge. In ETC2023, for example, of the $3.5 trillion total gross investment needs, energy generation and distribution make up for more than $2.4 trillion. In Vivid2021 it is $2 trillion of the total $4.2 trillion. </p>
        <p>In McKinsey2022, the investment needs in the power sector are basically the same, but they make up only one fifth of the total $9.2 trillion annual financing needs. As shown in the first figure, this is the highest estimate so far and by far. This is because the study does not use a bottom-up, but a top-down approach. For that, the authors start with the prediction from an integrated assessment model (IAM, a large model to simulate the interplay of climate developments and the economy) about how the economy would look in 2050, if the world achieved net-zero emissions (NZE) then and kept the 1.5° target. The scenario assumes an orderly transition with no delay. Specifically, the article applied the model REMIND by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is the basis for <a href=" https://www.dezernatzukunft.org/schumpeter-und-der-unaufhaltsame-fortschritt-gruener-technologien/#_ftn3" target="_blank">more than a quarter</a> of all studies evaluated in the current IPCC report. Of special interest are predictions regarding the energy mix and the size of different sectors, differentiated for multiple countries and regions. Where the results from the IAM are not detailed enough, they are further downscaled "manually". For the automobile sector, for example, the researchers broke total transportation in kilometre down into the use of different types of vehicles. In a next step, they estimated to cost of capital for all necessary replacements of physical assets, comparing the status quo with the predicted future. Therefore, investment here is not equivalent to investment as defined in the national accounts, because it also includes spending on consumer durables, such as electric cars. This is the most important reason for the much above average estimate of $9.2 trillion, since most studies would only include the costs for installing charging stations (and often, arbitrarily, battery production) when looking at the EV-sector, for example. McKinsey2022 aims at differentiating capital costs across regions as much as possible. Where no direct estimates are available, the authors assume higher capital costs in developing regions (e.g., twice as high as in developed regions in the building sector). What is interesting about their broad definition of investment as spending on physical assets in various sectors, is that it makes clear that most of climate finance requires a reallocation of investment instead of additional investments. In the below figure from McKinsey2022, the NZE scenario is compared with a current policies scenario (CP, already legislated policies leading to a temperature increase above 3°C). While total spending is just $1 trillion lower in CP as in NZW, only 50% of it is in low-emission assets. </p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/3 mckinsey study.png" id="img3"/>
      </div>


        <p>In contrast, most studies just cover green investment and define additional investment needs only in reference to that. Some even narrow it down further and do not include replacement/maintenance costs. Further differences steam from the inclusion vs exclusion of upstream investment costs. McKinsey2022, for example, only estimates capital costs for physical assets at the point of emissions, excluding other spending that may be necessary through the value chain (to minimize double counting). The general rule is simple: If the investment definition is very narrow, the estimate for total investment needs are typically lower but the financing gap much higher. But what other differences exist between studies?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important factor are expectations about technologies – both about those which already exists as well as new inventions. Let’s begin with the former. Overall it is good news, that humanity has already developed all the solutions it needs to end its fossil era. Furthermore, their deployment has become much less costly in the past and this trend can be expected to continue in the future. The decline in capital cost is an assumption that all studies make, see as an example the NZE scenario by NGFS:</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/4 cost developments.png" id="img4"/>
      </div>


        <p>Especially renewable energy production using wind turbines or solar PV is assumed to decrease strongly. As described by Levi Henze in detail <a href="https://www.dezernatzukunft.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Henze-2023-Master-Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, there are different concepts for how this technological progress comes to be: It may be assumed to be exogenous and not dependent on economic choices within the model (learning-by-waiting), driven by R&D investment (learning-by-searching), or the result of economies of scale, i.e. dependent on the total amount deployed (learning-by-doing). The assumption of constant efficiency gains over time made by most studies for at least some sector is an example for exogenous technological change and quite important for the final figures (in IEA2009, total efficiency gains make up for more than half of all emission reductions). But it is learning-by-doing which is responsible for falling costs of renewable energies in the above figure. For quantitative predictions, researchers need to estimate learning curves, i.e. by how much costs fall with every doubling of cumulative installed capacity (there are also multi-factor learning curve models taking other factors such as R&D expenditure into account). As <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332221006102#bib65" target="_blank">shown in Grant et al 2021</a>, differences in learning curves as well as expected deployment scenarios lead to a wide range of cost estimates in the literature, whereby IAM-based studies (summarized in Krey et al 2019) are on average more conservative than purely empirical papers:</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/5 grant costs.jpg" id="img5"/>
      </div>


        <p>Grant et al 2019 speculate that this difference could be caused by the "challenge for academic institutions [producing large scale IAMs] to keep abreast of real market development". As outlined by Henze 2022, this implies that the investment costs for reaching NZE are likely to be overestimated. However, there are also arguments for being more pessimistic with regard to installation costs. While there surely will be efficiency gains in the future, the price development for certain inputs is very uncertain. A three MW wind turbine, for example, requires approximately 1.5-2 tons of rare earths, 60% of which are mined and more than 90% of which are refined in China. What could happen if China were to use this economic weapon in the future can be imaged looking at the rare earth markets after a trade restriction by China in 2009, as in <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/twec.13172 target="_blank">Chen et al 2021</a>. It is obvious that severe supply chain restrictions in the current market settings would massively increase the costs of a green transition, despite all technological progress.</p>
        <p>But who knows, perhaps someone has invented a rare earth free wind turbine by then. And maybe new battery types will conquer EV markets in the next decade, making learning curves for current EV technologies obsolete. Such disruptive innovations are usually not part of model-based investment cost projects. However, almost all studies assume a leap forward in some technological areas, which seems to be by no way certain. This is especially the case for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Because I have no engineering background I cannot evaluate how optimistic the assumptions about the future role of CCUS are, but merely point out their relevance for most cost calculations. In its NZE scenario, the IEA calculated with more than 1200 Mt CO2 total CCUS capacity in 2030 and 6200 Mt in 2050, compared to 40 Mt today. This projection is also vastly above the future capacity of currently planned CCUS projects (around 280 Mt in 2030). In fact, CCUS is responsible for closing 15% of the gap between the IEA’s announced policy and the NZE scenario in 2030 and 40% of the gap in 2050. Similar assumptions are made in the scenarios by the IPCC or the NGFS. There are two driving forces behind this. First, costs are again assumed to fall strongly (this can also be seen the NGFS figure about electricity capital costs, e.g. comparing coal with and without CCUS). Secondly, increasing carbon prices create a business case for CCUS. In 2019, the IEA puts a price tag between <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/is-carbon-capture-too-expensive#:~:text=Levelised%20cost%20of%20CO2%20capture%20by%20sector%20and%20initial%20CO2%20concentration%2C%202019" target="_blank">$150-350 on CO2 removals</a> by direct air captures installations (by far the most expensive form of CCUS). This is similar to carbon price developments underlying multiple NGFS scenarios assuming a more or less delayed but in the end successful transition, so that CCUS can be expected to have a solid business case. All in all, the hopes for rapid CCUS increases do not seem to be completely unjustified. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that disappointments in this area would come costly: The IEA reports that without broad CCUS applications, its projected investment needs would be 19% higher (~$800 billion annually).</p>
        <p>Another, less discussed aspect of studies estimating green investment needs is the role of behavioural changes. In light of the previously discussed falling energy costs, the size of rebound effects (efficiency gains eaten up by an increase in consumption as a result of lower unit costs) is one example. Unfortunately, outside the energy sectors the uncertainties are no smaller. While not all studies take agriculture into account, diet changes could have a big impact on the emission budget - ideally in a good way (global meat consumption per capita decreases thanks to healthier diets in industrialised regions). In the WEO2022, the IEA "estimate[s] that, if sustainable and healthy diets were adopted worldwide and food waste halved, GHG emissions would be reduced by around 700 million tonnes of carbon‐dioxide equivalent annually. (…) This implies that animal calorie intake would not exceed 430 kilocalories per capita per day by 2030" (compared to 730 in the USA in 2010). Qualitatively similar assumptions about food consumption are implicitly made in the widely used NGFS NZE scenario, which projects falling land use for pasture globally despite a growing population. A <a href="https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/global-report/" target="_blank">study by the Food And Land Use Coalition</a> referenced in the IPCC2022 estimates that financing needs in the AFOLU sector are almost three times as high when there are no behavioural changes with respect to diets and food waste ($350 billion vs $135 billion annually).</p>
        <p>An even more important area for behavioural change is the transport sector. Here, the assumptions of studies are more diverse but in general share a rather conservative outlook. In the IEA2016 2° scenario, for example, the share of private cars in total mobility declines only by 6%, which does not look like a turning away from our system of private transportation (which is even the case for urban areas). Therefore, it is not surprising that total expenditures in the automobile sector do not change much, people are only expected to buy EVs instead of IC cars. However, even in such a world some adjustments are necessary. Besides electrification, the WEO2021 lists among others speed limits on autoroutes, increased ride sharing (especially in urban areas), and the replacement of short-distance plan travel with train services, since in its NZE scenario the amount of flying needs to stagnate on the 2019 level. This makes up for more than one third of necessary emission savings in the NZE scenario in 2030.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/6 behaviour.png" id="img6"/>
      </div>


        <p>The important message for politicians in the WEO2021: "Around 70% of the emissions saved by behavioural changes in the NZE in 2030 could be directly influenced or regulated by governments, for example by introducing low emissions zones in cities, or withdrawing licenses to operate regional air routes where a train alternative exists. The remaining emissions savings come from discretionary changes in peoples’ lives, such as reducing the water temperature of domestic boilers." Also, we need to keep in mind that even if we were to achieve the investment targets (we definitely do not at the moment), people in industrialised countries still have to make changes to their current way of living. Introducing non-financial accompanying measures does not substitute for some investment, but is a necessary complement.</p>
        <p>In fact, the political expectations underlying the various estimations are also very important to understand. This is especially the case when interpreting the economic results (such as potential BIP losses) from IAMs. The NGFS, for example, distinguishes five different policy scenarios, of which three are compatible with the Paris Agreement: An immediate and smooth policy path (optimal), an immediate but divergent policy reaction across sectors, and a delayed transition. Those correspond to the different CO2 emission paths in the second figure above, which actually has another panel about the assumed carbon price developments:</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/7 carbon price.png" id="img7"/>
      </div>


        <p>The carbon price assumptions are important for climate financing in two main regards: Firstly, if carbon prices do not rise fast enough, they do not sufficiently alter consumer behaviour, such as energy saving or less usage of (IC) cars. Consequently, the amount of green investment compatible with the same target increases (for example, because the total amount of green power generated needs to be higher). Secondly, as already explained in the section about CCUS, a strong and predictable (!) carbon price increase is necessary to make certain green investments profitable for private investors. Therefore, the carbon price determines how much of the investments required are made by the private sector instead of the public sector. This is especially the case in developed countries, whereas the barriers for private investments in developing countries are larger and require additional policy measures. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/how%20the%20european%20union%20could%20achieve%20net%20zero%20emissions%20at%20net%20zero%20cost/net-zero-europe-vf.pdf" target="_blank">report by McKinsey</a> about the green transition in Europe found, that currently only half of all necessary investment would turn a profit, while this share increases to 75% with a carbon price of €50/tCO2 and 85% with a carbon price of €100/tCO2. This supports the notion of most studies that in industrialised regions the private sector must finance considerably more than half of all required investments.</p>
        <p>Speaking of cost sharing, we finally need to ask what we consider as costs. This question is more relevant than one might think at first glance, even beyond the already discussed issue of which sectors are covered. The main reason for that is the role of opportunity costs. While most studies define costs only as capital expenditure on new green assets, it is clear that such an approach is of little use to calculate the costs for greening, say, the agricultural sector. After all, there are zero investment costs for leaving land fallow, but it is evident that for a farmer that measure is very costly. In the IPCC2022, total financing needs in the AFOLU sectors of $280 billion annually by 2030 (rising to $430 billion later) are pretty much equally split between investment costs and opportunity costs. To what extent these costs materialize for the public depends on the policy reaction, of course (e.g., compensation payments for farmers). But to put this number into context, global agricultural subsidies are estimated to be around $800 billion each year. Financially more important is the question of who bears the costs for all the stranded assets, such as coal power plants but also private heating systems which need to be shut down. McKinsey2022 values the total amount of stranded assets in the energy sector alone at $2.1 trillion in 2050 (this does not count into their $9.2 billion number).</p>
        <p>On the plus side, there are also some gains which are often left out of the picture. Firstly, there are reduced expenditures for fossil investment or consumption as well as lower subsidies for high-emission activities. Secondly, we can expect a massive reduction in hidden costs, for example stemming from air pollution or unhealthy diets. The <a href="https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/global-report/" target="_blank">Food And Land Use Coalition 2019</a> estimates that avoided hidden costs thanks to the green transition in the AFOLU sector amount to $5.7 trillion by 2030 and $10.5 trillion by 2050. This as a large net gain compared to the investment needs of $300-350 annually in the next decade. However, while such estimates of welfare gains may be important for political communication, they are of limited use for discussions about financing sources.</p>
        <p>Hopefully, it has become clear by this point that many assumptions, both explicit and implicit, enter the calculation of investment needs. Therefore, it would not be a good idea to settle on a single value by averaging all the numbers in the first figure. Another very basic reason for this is that the studies are from different years. One might be tempted to simply adjust the estimates for inflation, but that would not make much sense, because only price changes for some investment goods matter and because studies project them into the future. However, it is important to account for the reference period. For example, OECD2017 reports a $2.7 billion investment requirement for 2016-2030. With current green investments standing at $1.8 billion, this leaves an annual financing need of $5.4 billion for the period 2022-2030 – twice as high as the initial estimate.</p>
        <p>The good (or actually very bad) news is that the debate about how large investment needs are exactly does not really matter. Compared to both implemented policies as well as announced pledges, it is evident that both the public and the private sector need to do much more, much faster. The gap between what is planned and what is necessary annually can probably be estimated at around $1-2 trillion. How to close this gap very much depends on the region and the sector of interest. As already mentioned, the role the public sector needs to play is much large in developing countries or for adaptation projects.</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/8 public vs private.png" id="img8"/>
      </div>

        <p>The requirement of large public expenditure programs in EMDE (emerging markets and developing countries, in this context usually without China) implies a massive need for transfers from developed countries. The necessary transfers are estimated to be around $300 billion (ETC2023), while of total climate related expenditures in EMDE $1 trillion p.a. must come from external sources (IHLEG2022). To contrast these numbers again with the status quo: Currently the developed countries struggle to even hold their promise of making available $100 billion annually for climate finance in EMDE from 2020 onwards. Note that this includes both public transfers as private capital mobilised through public actions.</p>
        <p>So, what needs to be done? It should not come as a surprise (although it apparently often does for politicians) that an important part of the answer is really just "give more money". It is obvious that the current fiscal space of EMDE is not sufficient to enable large scale public investment. In the future, this fiscal space will probably become even smaller, since less developed regions will suffer most from physical climate risks – which is why a well-capitalized international loss and damage fund would be so important. However, organisations like <a href="https://debtforclimate.org/" target="_blank">Debt For Climate</a> point out that this is not enough: If rich countries acknowledge that they owe something to vulnerable countries because of their responsibility for climate change, they should immediately settle part of their moral debt by cancelling the financial debt of poor countries. The IMF states that 60% of low-income countries are in high risk of or already in debt distress (April 2023). The financial burden from public debt not only makes investing in a sustainable and safe future much more difficult, the continuing interest rate payments also require tapping short-term cash sources such as fossil resource extraction – again accelerating climate change. And even if creditor countries worried about whether borrowing countries really use their additional fiscal space from debt reliefs for climate expenditures, they could rely on instruments such as debt-for-nature swaps or sustainability-linked-bonds, which both oblige the benefitting party to implement specific green policies. The means exist, the political will does not.</p>
        <p>If politicians do not want to talk about their countries own money, they focus on private sector mobilization. They can always agree on the importance of ESG standards (although not about their specific design) or greater data transparency regulations for firms to steer private capital into green assets. But this does not address the main problem: risk. A study by >a href=" https://odi.org/en/publications/blended-finance-in-the-poorest-countries-the-need-for-a-better-approach/" target="_blank">Attridge and Engen 2019</a> finds that for every dollar from public development programs, private finance mobilisation amounts to $1.06 in lower-middle-income countries and only $0.37 in low-income countries. Private investors are reluctant to go into those countries because of high investment risks caused by bad institutions (legal security, ownership rights etc.), high policy uncertainty, or exchange rate risk. As a result, even projects with a solid profit rate are often not realized, as reported in IHLEG2022:</p>

    <div class="figure">
        <img src="../../static/investment-needs-green-transition/9 risk returns.png" id="img9"/>
      </div>


        <p>To counter these factors and to de-risk projects for the private sector, development institutions such as multilateral development banks (MDBs) should provide much more blended finance. Although this can come in a broad variety of forms, it boils down to loading the riskiest part of an asset on a public balance sheet, leaving the private sector with a low(er)-risk, investable asset. However, current funding by MDBs like the Worldbank are not supposed to be too risky, because donors from richer countries do not want the Worldbank to lose its triple A rating (yes, it is worrying that governments restrict development finance out of fear of potential downgradings by a handful of private companies). Combine this with their reluctance to give more money and it becomes clear why current negotiations about a Worldbank reform are so difficult.</p>
        <p>There are many more specific policy proposals to upscale climate finance from giving green assets a preferential status in the Basel-III regulations to implementing a sector-specific carbon price floor to make green investments more profitable worldwide (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/05/19/blog-why-countries-must-cooperate-on-carbon-prices" target="blank">as proposed by the IMF</a>). That insufficient action is not caused by a lack of options can also be seen from the CBI’s <a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/policy/101-policymakers" target="_blank">101 policy ideas for a sustainable finance policy package</a>.</p>
        <p>The bottom line: We do not really know how much investment the green transformation requires, but we certainly know that it is a lot. Moreover, we do not really know how much damage climate change will cause, but we definitely know it will be much much costlier to let climate change accelerate even more than to implement swift actions to mitigate it as much as we can. We also know which actions are required and that they are feasible, but there is insufficient political will. What I personally do not know is how I feel about that… </p>
